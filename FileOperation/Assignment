ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS – ANSWERS
(File System and Streams – Node.js)
====================================================

1. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations

Synchronous file operations:

- Execution of the program stops until the file operation is completed.
- The next line of code runs only after the operation finishes.
- It is simpler but slower for large files.

Asynchronous file operations:

- Execution of the program does not stop.
- File operations run in the background.
- It is faster and more efficient for large applications.

2. When should you use file streams instead of reading the entire file?

File streams should be used when:

- The file size is very large.
- Memory usage needs to be minimized.
- Data is processed line by line.
- Working with log files or continuous data.

Streams read data in small chunks instead of loading the entire file at once.

3. Purpose of the 'utf8' encoding parameter in file operations

The 'utf8' encoding parameter:

- Converts file data into readable text format.
- Ensures correct display of characters.
- Prevents data from being returned as binary or buffer format.

Without 'utf8', file content is returned as raw binary data.

4. Common error codes in file system operations and their meanings

ENOENT : File or directory does not exist  
EACCES : Permission denied  
EISDIR : Operation attempted on a directory  
EMFILE : Too many open files  
ENOTDIR : Expected a directory but found a file

5. How would you safely delete a directory with all its contents?

To safely delete a directory:

- First check whether the directory exists.
- Remove all files inside the directory.
- Delete all subdirectories recursively.
- Finally delete the main directory.

This prevents errors and accidental data loss.

6. Explain the concept of piping in streams with an example

Piping is used to transfer data from one stream to another automatically.

For example:

- Reading data from a file.
- Writing that data directly into another file.

Piping improves performance and reduces memory usage.

7. Why is it important to handle errors in file operations?

Error handling is important because:

- Files may not exist.
- Permission may be denied.
- Disk may be full.
- Program may crash without proper handling.

Handling errors makes the program reliable and stable.

8. Difference between writeFile and appendFile methods

writeFile:

- Overwrites the existing content of a file.
- Creates a new file if it does not exist.

appendFile:

- Adds new content to the end of the file.
- Preserves the existing content.
